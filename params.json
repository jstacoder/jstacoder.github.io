Its kind of up to you.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from os import path\r\n>>> print os.path.realpath(os.path.curdir)\r\n>>> print 'Python examples'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, your confused.\r\n>> left over from the original template\r\n\r\n### Flask\r\nI work as a web developer and as such i spend a lot of time learning about web frameworks. I have used them all, and i must say none can compare to Flask. I will get into it more in the future, but Flask is a great web framework\r\n\r\n### Magento\r\nNow im not really a fan of PHP or PHP frameworks, but as this is my job, being a fan dosent always deiced if i work with it or not. Sometimes that is somthing i _have_ to do, and in the case of Magento that is for sure. \r\nbut i have managed to gain a bit of experience with it that id like to share here.\r\n\r\n### SugarCrm\r\nSame idea as Magento, not a fan, but use it alot. \r\n\r\n[My blog](kyle-vm.level2designs.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
