## CopyIcon

By itself the `CopyIcon` doesnt really do much beyond
looking nice.

<Box>
   <CopyIcon/>
</Box>

As you can see it gives the user visual feedback via
a hover color, but that is really all

To make real use of it, use its companion `ClipBoardHelper`

The helpers job is to handle clicks, which will call a click 
callback and it provides a popover and updates its text. 


<Box mb={3}>
  <ClipBoardHelper  copyText="testing 1 2 3"/>
</Box>


```jsx 
<ClipBoardHelper  textToCopy="testing 1 2 3"/>
```
