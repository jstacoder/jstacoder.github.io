import { BorderBox, Text } from '@primer/components'

## Why do i want to replace the react-live Editor?

Because I like using react-live for these cool live code examples.

```jsx live=true
<BorderBox bg='blue.2' p={2} m={3}>
    <Text color='bodytext' m={2}>
        cool huh?
    </Text>
</BorderBox>
```

But i realized that i wasnt a fan of the editor they were using. 
Im not going to point any fingers... or name any names, but i felt 
the editing experience could have been a little smoother. 

So i decided to try and see if I could use react-ace instead. 

## Investigation

First thing is I need to see how react-live has implemented its default editor to see 
how easy it may or may not be to customize the editor. 

Luckily the `LiveEditor` component is already a seperate piece of the api, so i can just define a
custom `LiveEditor` that uses react-ace. Also i noticed that react-live is using the React context
api to provide data from the editor to the previewer, so this may be eaiser than i had thought. 


## Start coding

Now that we know what to do lets start by redefining the editor to use Ace. 


```jsx filename=editor.jsx
export const CodeEditor = ({code, disabled, language, onChange, style, theme})=>{

    const getCode = useMemo(()=> code, [code])

    const [editorCode, setEditorCode] = useState(getCode)

    const updateContent = useCallback(
        code =>{
            setEditorCode(code)
            onChange(code)
        }, [editorCode]
    )
    
    return (
        <AceEditor
            width={'100%'}
            value={editorCode}
            onChange={updateContent}
            style={style}
            name="blah"
            mode={'jsx'}
            theme="monokai"
            height="10vh"
            showGutter={true}/>
    )
}
```

we just need to be sure that it has the same interface (ie: props) as the one
from react-live, that means:  


1. code - the code to edit  
2. disabled - self explanitory  
3. language - what language should be used to define highlighting  
4. onChange - callback for managing a controlled component  
5. style - self explanitory  
6. theme - we wont use this  


So if you notice all we are really doing here is wrapping the `AceEditor` component to keep the state of the code, 
making sure we rerender if it changes. 

Now lets redefine the `LiveEditor` component that mangages the live context and passes it to our editor.


```jsx filename=live-editor.jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { LiveContext } from 'react-live'
import CodeEditor from './editor.jsx'

export const LiveEditor = props =>{
    const {
        code, language, theme, disabled, onChange
    } = useContext(LiveContext)

    return (
        <CodeEditor 
            {...props} 
            theme={theme} 
            code={code} 
            language={language} 
            disabled={disabled} 
            onChange={onChange}/>
    )
}
```

So here we are just extracting the context provided by react-live and 
passing it to our component. 

now we can just use it like this:

```jsx filename=pre.jsx
import {LiveError, LivePreview, LiveProvider} from 'react-live'

import { LiveEditor } from './editor'

export default ({code})=>(
<LiveProvider code={code}>
    <LivePreview/>
    <LiveEditor/>
    <LiveError/>
</LiveProvider>
)
```
