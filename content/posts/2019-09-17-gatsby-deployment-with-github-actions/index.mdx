### Why Automate Stuff?

I have recently been developing my Gatsby sites on various platforms, 
osx, windows, and between them linux via docker. 

My main goal is the ability to do `gatsby build` and `gh-pages -d public -b master` without issues between platforms

what kind of issues am i talking about?


* __node__ __memory__ issues
    * On both osx and windows i occsionally get odd `out of memory` errors in node when building  
    
Because of that I found it helpful to just use docker and docker-compose to run the build command

* __cross__ __platform__ __sharp__ issues
    * because i like to run the dev server locally 
      (more because its one less step than anything)
      i ended up with running into issues with sharp in the node modules
      being built for the wrong plartform

Now there are ways to avoid that as well, mainly using docker volumes to isolate the node modules between platforms,
but it still didnt feel right

### Github Actions

Then i found Github Actions

According to github using them you can automate any software development process.

You do that by adding a workflow configuration file to your git repo,
then based on that file github will do your bidding. It can do all kinds of 
things for you:

* run shell commands in various shells including:
    * bash
    * python
    * ruby

* run a javascript file that has access to your code and access to an api to manipulate various things
* all the way to launching a docker container with w/e dockerfile you want

Talk about convienient!

Now This will work, let see what it will take to setup a workflow to just build and deploy my gatsby sites.

First we need to give our worklow a name:

```yml
name: Build and Deploy Gatsby
```

Luckily the syntax is pretty easy, so to start you need to tell it when to run,
I want it to run when i push changes to my develop branch, other branchs
that arent master are branchs for features and bugs, and the master branch i deploy the site to so it sould only run the builds when 
i push to the develop branch. 

Here is how to do it:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop      
```

Ok now we define our jobs, i say jobs because we can have multiple
but i only have one

To define jobs you have a top-level `jobs` key 
whose value is a mapping and the key is the jobs name
and its value is another mapping to define the job, my jos name is build

```yml
jobs: 
  build:    
```


To define a job it needs a name, it needs to know what kind of platform to run on
and it needs a list of steps to run

```yml
    name: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

To define a step you have a few options you can:
* use predefined or your own custom actions (which can be javascript files or dockerfiles)
* run shell commands
* set environment variables
* use secrets set in githubs settings
amoung other things

for our first step we checkout our repo using a predefined action from github
```yml
      - name: checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
```

our next step installs our dependencies

```yml
      - name: install
        run: yarn install 
```

the next step runs `yarn build` which is an alias for `gatsby build --prefix-paths`

```yml
      - name: build
        run: yarn build
```

Finally i deploy it to github pages using another predefined action,
but because its pushing to our repo it needs an api token, but luckily 
github provides one as `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` you just need to add it as
an environment variable

```yml
      - name: deploy
        uses: maxheld83/ghpages@v0.2.1
        env: 
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 
          BUILD_DIR: 'public/'
```
