## Overriding MDX layout in frontmatter

I really like using docz, and since they have integrated with Gatbsy
and Theme-UI i like it even more.

One thing i like is how you can completley override the way it
does things, or you can just shadow individual components, to only override
what you want.

But one thing i dont like is that by default when you override the `Layout` component
it takes over every docz page,

> But what if i only want to overide the layout on certain pages?

Heres how to do it:

* a
* b
* c
